**The Rundown: **Google just [debuted](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/AlphaEvolve.pdf) AlphaEvolve, a coding agent that harnesses Gemini and evolutionary strategies to craft algorithms for scientific and computational challenges ‚Äî driving efficiency inside Google and solving historic math problems.

**The details: **

* AlphaEvolve uses a mix of Gemini models (Flash for idea generation, Pro for analysis) to create code, which is tested by evaluators and evolved iteratively.

* The system has already made several mathematical discoveries, including finding the first improvement on Strassen's algorithm from 1969.

* It is also boosting efficiency for Google, optimizing data center scheduling, improving AI training (including its own), and helping with chip design.

* When tested on 50+ open math problems, it matched SOTA solutions in 75% and discovered entirely new, improved solutions in another 20%.

**Why it matters: **Yesterday, we had OpenAI‚Äôs Jakub Pachocki [saying](https://www.therundown.ai/p/googles-gemini-ai-expands-across-devices) AI has shown ‚Äúsignificant evidence‚Äù of being capable of novel insights, and today Google has taken that a step further. Math plays a role in nearly every aspect of life, and AI‚Äôs pattern and algorithmic strengths look ready to uncover a whole new world of scientific discovery.

###### ANTHROPIC

#### üöÄ [_**Anthropic set to launch new Sonnet, Opus models**_](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anthropics-upcoming-models-will-think-think)

**The Rundown: **Anthropic is reportedly [preparing](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anthropics-upcoming-models-will-think-think) to launch advanced versions of Claude‚Äôs Sonnet and Opus models in the ‚Äúupcoming weeks,‚Äù featuring hybrid thinking and expanded tool use capabilities.

**The details:**

* The models are reportedly capable of alternating between reasoning and tool use, and can self-correct by stepping back to examine what went wrong.

* For coding, the models can test their generated code, ID errors, troubleshoot with reasoning, and make corrections without requiring human intervention.

* An Anthropic model, codenamed Neptune, is [undergoing](https://www.testingcatalog.com/new-claude-neptune-model-undergoes-red-team-review-at-anthropic/) safety testing, with some believing the name hints at a 3.8 (8th planet from the sun) release.

* The news coincides with Anthropic [launching](https://www.anthropic.com/news/testing-our-safety-defenses-with-a-new-bug-bounty-program) a new bug bounty program focused on testing Claude‚Äôs principles on safety measures.  

**Why it matters: **While Anthropic has been in the mix with Google and OpenAI for the top model in the industry, the company has been much slower to bring new ones to market ‚Äî with 3.7 Sonnet in February marking its only release in 2025. With both other rivals also likely releasing upgrades soon, we could be in for a wild few months.

###### OPENAI

#### üîç [_OpenAI‚Äôs new Safety Evaluations dashboard_](https://openai.com/safety/evaluations-hub/)

**The Rundown: **OpenAI [launched](https://openai.com/safety/evaluations-hub/) a new Safety Evaluations Hub that will publicly and regularly display test results for its AI models, showing how they perform on metrics like harmful content generation, hallucination rates, and jailbreak attempts.

**The details: **

* The hub shows comparative performance data across OAI models, including metrics for refusing harmful content and accuracy on factual questions.

* The dashboard currently focuses on four categories: harmful content, jailbreak vulnerability, hallucination rates, and adherence to instruction hierarchy.

* OpenAI promises to update the page "periodically" as part of what it calls a company-wide effort to communicate more proactively about AI safety.

* The release comes after critiques that the company is not transparent with safety testing, and following issues with a recent [rollout](https://www.therundown.ai/p/chatgpts-personality-problem) of a GPT 4o update.

**Why it matters: **With labs racing to push out models to keep pace with rivals, many believe safety has been taking a backseat to speed. This is a great step towards more transparency, but it will be relying on OpenAI to self-report and continually update the data ‚Äî which likely won‚Äôt completely satisfy those calling for stricter safety measures.
